<A NAME="background"><H3>Background</H3></A>

The purpose of the Maruti project is to create an environment for the
development and deployment of critical applications with hard real-time
constraints in a reactive environment. Such applications must be able to
execute on a platform consisting of distributed and heterogeneous
resources and operate continuously in the presence of faults.

<P>

The Maruti project started in 1988. The first version of the system was
designed as an object-oriented system with suitable extensions for
objects to support real-time operation. The proof-of-concept version of
this design was implemented to run on top of the Unix operating system
and supported hard and non-real-time applications running in a
distributed, heterogeneous environment. The feasibility of the
fault-tolerant concepts incorporated in the design of Maruti system were
also demonstrated. No changes to the Unix kernel were made in that
implementation, which was operational in 1990. We realized that Unix is
not a very hospitable host for real-time applications, as very little
control over the use of resources can be exercised in that system without
extensive modifications to the kernel. Therefore, based on the lessons
learned from the first design, we proceeded with the design of the
current version of Maruti and changed the implementation base to
<!WA13><A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/mach/public/www/mach.html">CMU Mach</A>
which permitted more direct control of resources.

<P>

Most recently, we have implemented Maruti directly on 486 PC hardware,
providing Maruti applications total control over resources. The initial
version of the distributed Maruti has also been implemented, allowing
Maruti applications to run across a network in a synchronized, hard
real-time manner.

<P>

<a name="goals"><H3>Design Goals</H3></a>

The design of a real-time system must take into consideration the primary
characteristics of the applications which are to be supported. The design
of Maruti has been guided by the following application characteristics
and requirements:

<UL>

<LI><B>Real-Time Requirements</B>
<P>
The most important requirement for real-time systems is the capability to
support the timely execution of applications. In contrast with many
existing systems, next-generation systems will require support for hard,
soft, and non-real-time applications on the same platform.
<P>

<LI><B>Fault Tolerance</B>
<P>
Many of the mission-critical systems are safety-critical, and therefore
have fault tolerance requirements. In this context, fault tolerance is the
ability of a system to support continuous operation in the presence of
faults.
<P>
Although a number of techniques for supporting fault-tolerant systems have
been suggested in the literature, they rarely consider the real-time
requirements of the system. A real-time operating system must provide
support for fault tolerance and exception handling capabilities for
increased reliability while continuing to satisfy the timing requirements.
<P>

<LI><B>Distributivity</B>
<P>
The inherent characteristics of many systems require that multiple
autonomous computers, connected through a local area network, cooperate
in a distributed manner. The computers and other resources in the system
may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Due to the autonomous operation of
the components which cooperate, system control and coordination becomes
a much more difficult task than if the system were implemented in a
centralized manner. The techniques learned in the design and
implementation of centralized systems do not always extend to distributed
systems in a straightforward manner.
<P>

<LI><B>Scenarios</B>
<P>
Many real-time applications undergo different modes of operation during
their life cycle. A scenario defines the set of jobs executing in the
system at any given time. A hard real-time system must be capable of
switching from one scenario to another, maintaining the system in a safe
and stable state at all times, without violating the timing constraints.
<P>

<LI><B>Integration of Multiple Requirements</B>
<P>
The major challenge in building operating systems for mission-critical
computing is the integration of multiple requirements. Because of the
conflicting nature of some of the requirements and the solutions
developed to date, integration of all the requirements in a single
system is a formidable task. For example, the real-time requirements
preclude the use of many of the fault handling techniques used in other
fault-tolerant systems.

</UL>

<a name="approach"><H3>Design Approach and Principles</H3></a>

Maruti is a time-based system in which the resources are reserved prior
to execution. The resource reservation is done on the time line, thus
allowing for reasoning about real-time properties in a natural way. The
time-driven architecture provides predictable execution for real-time
systems, a necessary requirement for critical applications requiring
hard real-time performance. The basic design approach is outlined below:

<UL>

<LI><B>Resource Reservation for Hard Real-Time Jobs</B>
<P>
Hard real-time applications in Maruti have advance resource reservation
resulting in a priori guarantees about the timely execution of hard
real-time jobs. This is achieved through a <EM>calendar</EM> data structure
which keeps track of all resource reservations and the assigned time
intervals. The resource requirements are specified as early as possible
in the development stage of an application and are manipulated, analyzed,
and refined through all phases of application development.
<P>

<LI><B>Predictability through Reduction of Resource Contention</B>
<P>
Hard real-time jobs are scheduled using a time-driven scheduling paradigm
in which the resource contention between jobs is eliminated through
scheduling. This results in reduced run time overheads and leads to a high
degree of predictability. However, not all jobs can be pre-scheduled.
Since resources may be shared between jobs in the calendar and other jobs
in the system, such as non-real-time activities, there may be resource
contention leading to lack of predictability. This is countered by
eliminating as much of resource contention as possible and reducing it
whenever it is not possible to eliminate it entirely. The lack of
predictability is compensated by allowing enough slack in the schedule.
<P>

<LI><B>Integrated Support for Fault Tolerance</B>
<P>
Fault tolerance objectives are achieved by integrating the support for
fault tolerance at all levels in the system design. Fault tolerance is
supported by early fault detection and handling, resilient application
structures through redundancy, and the capability to switch modes of
operation. Fault detection capabilities are integrated with the
application during its development, permitting the use of
application-specific fault detection and fault handling. As fault
handling may result in violation of temporal constraints, replication
is used to make the application resilient. Failure of a replica may not
affect the timely execution of other replicas and thereby the operation
of the system it may be controlling. Under anticipated load and failure
conditions, it may become necessary for the system to revoke the
guarantees given to the hard real-time applications and change its mode
of operation dynamically so that an acceptable degraded mode of
operation may continue.
<P>

<LI><B>Separation of Mechanism and Policy</B>
<P>
In the design of Maruti, an emphasis has been placed on separating
mechanism from policy. Thus, for instance, the system provides basic
dispatching mechanisms for a time-driven system, keeping the design
of specific scheduling policies separate. The same approach is
followed in other aspects of the system. By separating the mechanism
from the policy, the system can be tailored and optimized to
different environments.
<P>

<LI><B>Portability and Extensibility</B>
<P>
Unlike many other real-time systems, the aim of the Maruti project has
been to develop a system which can be tailored to use in a wide variety
of situations-from small embedded systems to complex mission critical
systems. With the rapid change in hardware technology, it is imperative
that the design be such that it is portable to different platforms and
makes minimal assumptions about the underlying hardware platform.
Portability and extensibility is also enhanced by using modular design
with well defined interfaces. This allows for integration of new
techniques into the design with relative ease.
<P>

<LI><B>Support of Hard, Soft, and Non-Real-Time in the Same Environment</B>
<P>
Many critical systems consist of applications with a mix of hard, soft,
and non-real-time requirements. Since they may be sharing data and
resources, they must execute within the same environment. The approach
taken in Maruti is to support the integrated execution of applications
with multiple requirements by reducing and bounding the unpredictable
interaction between them.
<P>

<LI><B>Support for Distributed Operation</B>
<P>
Many embedded systems need several processors to carry out their
computations. When multiple processors function autonomously, their use
in hard real-time applications requires operating system support for
coordinated resource management. Maruti provides coordinated, time-based
resource management of all resources in a distributed environment
including the processors and the communication channels.
<P>

<LI><B>Support for Multiple Execution Environments</B>
<P>
Maruti provides support for multiple execution environments to
facilitate program development as well as execution. Real-time
applications may execute in the Maruti/Mach or Maruti/Standalone
environments and maintain a high degree of temporal determinacy. The
Maruti/Standalone environment is best suited for the embedded
applications while Maruti/Mach permits the concurrent execution of
hard real-time and non-real-time Unix applications. In addition, the
Maruti/Virtual environment has been designed to aid the development
of real-time applications. In this environment the same code which runs
in the other two environments can execute while access to all Unix
debugging tools is available. In this environment temporal accuracy is
maintained with respect to a <EM>virtual real-time</EM>.
<P>

<LI><B>Support for Temporal Debugging</B>
<P>
When an application executes in the Maruti/Virtual environment its
interactions are carried out with respect to virtual real-time which is
under the control of the user. The user may speed it up with respect to
actual time or slow it down. The virtual time may be paused at any
instant and the debugging tools used to examine the state of the
execution. In this way we may debug an application while maintaining all
temporal relationships, a process we call <EM>temporal debugging</EM>.
