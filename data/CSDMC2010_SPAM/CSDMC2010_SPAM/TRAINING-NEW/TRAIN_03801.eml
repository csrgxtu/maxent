Craig,

    I don't really understand how you can make the claims that you
    make without a full understanding of TeS, which you can't have
    because we haven't published the details.

    In the end, given that you don't know much about TeS or how it
    works, your statements really call into question your intentions
    given that you have a competing product in this space.

Regards,
