Hi,


I'm trying to redirect from a site to another, and it works....but i want
that when it redirects it shows the original address and not the destination
address, the line that i have at the moment and works without hide the
redirection is:

RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://openmeetings.innovagroup.es:5080/openmeetings
[R=301

I've read in google that changing the [R=301] to [P], it should works ...but
it shows that is a forbiden site when I change it.

Someone knows how can i get it???

thanks
