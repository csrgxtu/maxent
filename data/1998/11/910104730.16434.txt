According to Dr. Martin Feinberg: 
       "This is an amazing and unique tape. The sounds were designed to stimultate brain centers. To enhance pleasure. Reach new levels of sexual experiences without any chemicals or drugs but rather by allowing you mind to be stimulated by audio signals. The velvet voice provides a hypnotic-like state that produces a flow of intense pleasure and satisfaction. All that you need to do is listen."
