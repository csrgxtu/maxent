JUST RELEASED!!!
INTRODUCING...THE CD VOL. 2   

The CD - Vol. 2, is the absolute best product of its' kind anywhere 
in the world today.  There are no other products anywhere that can 
compete with the quality of this product.

We took a total of over 190 million email addresses from many of the
touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some were $300+)!
We added the millions we had in storage to those.   When we
combined them all, we had in excess of 300+ million addresses
in one huge file.

We  ran a super "sort/de-dupe" program against this huge list. It 
cut the file down to less than 20 million!!! Can you believe that? It 
seems that most people that are selling CD's are duping the public by 
putting numerous files of addresses in the CD over and over. This 
created many duplicate addresses. They also had many program "generated" 
email addresses like CompuServe, MCI, ANON's, etc.  This causes a 
tremendous amount of undeliverables.

After completion of removal of duplicates and initial filtering we were 
left with the base of 10 Million addresses worth fine tuning to finish the 
project.  Remember, we are not here to produce the CD with the gad zillion 
millions that our competitors are so proud to put their names on these days.  
We ARE here to produce the very BEST CD list as far as quality of 
addresses go

We then ran a program that contained 300+ keywords to remove addresses
with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster, webmaster, flamer, 
abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .EDU, mil, .org, .GOV, Genie, 
Delphi, GNN, Wow etc.   We also filtered out all addresses found in any of 
our 1300+ domains list.  We also filtered out addresses in excess of 30,000 
which have proven to be affiliated with anyone found to be opposed to our 
using direct bulk email as a advertising medium. We have also purged the 
list to be free of any "web poison" addresses created by those who are opposed 
to us conducting legitimate business on the internet today.  If you do not know 
what web poisoned addresses are, please look it up now.  One list we recently 
purchased had over 90% poisoned addresses.  The "bottom line" here is that 
you can go out on the world market today and purchase every lists for thousands 
of dollars and NOT have anymore worth owning than what we have compiled 
for you here today.

You use these addresses, you will experience increased response, increased 
sales, and a host of other positives that far exceeds any hoped for results when 
using the competitor's inferior products.  Our customers purchase our products 
over and over and over.  Most of the competition ever succeeds is selling a 
second product to anyone after they purchase the first.

  So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are 
out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like using the 200+ million that 
we started with, but a lot less money and a lot less time!!
 
We have always said, "You can buy from the REST or you can buy from the BEST".   
Your choice.

                     _____________________________

"I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I
 immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over
 the course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I
 received less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied
with my purchase!!  Thanks Premier!!"
