Please excuse this intrusion. 

Your Name Has ALREADY BEEN DELETED from our database.

I would like to let you in on a good idea...

I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE THE ONE TELLING YOU THIS....

I  ACTUALLY READ & ACTED ON THIS PIECE OF E-MAIL,
AND THEN WENT TO  EUROPE FOR THE HOLIDAYS, PAYING FOR IT IN CASH!

My name is Matthew Forti ; I'm a 42-year-old father, husband, and full time
scientist.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my
account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same
e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.

About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject
line, I finally read it. Afterwards, I thought, "OK, I give in, I'm going
to try this. I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand,
there is nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash." I promptly
mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports paid a friend of mine
a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me. After reading
the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free!

I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my
P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills
up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!
I am stunned by all the cash that keeps rolling in!

I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared
to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your
money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to
be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are. If you can open an
envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your
way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy
it is. Believe me, it works!

GO FOR IT NOW!

Sincerely,

Matthew Forti

Personal note from Joseph Wm. Moss:
Hi! My name is Joseph Wm. Moss.  

I just wanted to say that this mailing really does work.  I have done it
three times and made OVER $50,000 each time.  The reports will really help
you to get things going and make you a success, but you must follow the
directions exactly, otherwise there is no guarantee.

I can guarantee that you are starting on the bottom floor of this new
mailing.  It is fresh from the start.  I guarantee you will make money if
you follow through and keep getting people to mail this list, (at least 10
for the first level and 200 for the second)  It’ll really snowball after a
while.  GO FOR IT!!, and MAKE A TON OF CASH!

Sincerely,
Joseph Wm. Moss

When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program
works perfectly... 100% OF THE TIME!

Thousands of people have used this program to:

-  Even retire!

This is your chance, so read on and get started today!

------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do:

We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing
to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our
business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state
in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your
computer).

The products in this program are a series of four business and financial
reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will
include:

* $5.00 cash *
* The name and number of the report they are ordering. *
* The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered. *

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!
The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing
business anywhere!

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!

******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you
don't order them).

*  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a
problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report.
MAKE  SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL
PROBLEMS!

*  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports.
You will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer
and resell them.

*  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to
send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to
each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is
instructed below in steps "a" through "f" or you will lose out on the
majority of your profits.  Once you  understand the way this works, you'll
also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has
been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. ( I talked to a friend
last month who has also done this program.  He said he had tried "playing"
with it to change the results.  Bad idea.... he never got as much money as
he did with the un-altered version.  Remember, it's a proven method!

a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.

b.  After you've ordered the four reports, take this advertisement and
remove the name and address under REPORT #4. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their 50 grand!

c.  Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.

d.  Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.

e.  Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.

f.  Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY!

3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and
save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction
portion of this letter.

4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the INTERNET!
Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS
of FREE places to advertise. Another avenue which you could use for
advertising is e-mail lists. You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000
addresses or you can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for
you.

BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!

5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL
ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't advertise until
they receive the report!

------------------------------------------

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume
your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing
a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also
assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline
members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................$50.
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..............$500.
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).........$5,000.
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000).....$50,000.

THIS TOTALS	------------------------------------>        $55,550.

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit
10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people
to participate!  Most people get 100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can
afford $20). You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail
is FREE!

REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and
purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on
trade!

About 50,000 new people get online every month!

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******

*  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the
directions accurately.

*  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them
when the orders start coming in because:

*  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws, Title
18, Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state
that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."

*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

*  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL be SUCCESSFUL!

*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!


******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should
receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2. If you don't, continue
advertising until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX,
because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to
roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of
a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching
which report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more
income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!
There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!


******* T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S *******

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the
rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't
work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it
works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money,
with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the
program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.

My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail."
I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and
percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my
supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing
didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received
over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 
bills! I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it 
wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby." 
I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race"
and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.

I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any
doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked
with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely
is! IT WORKS!!!

Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount
of money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked
this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the
minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received
$36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.

Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind
to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I 
surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!
For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at
the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life
before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in
the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a
faster return.

Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...
11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than
$41,000 on the first try!!

D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN
++++++++++++++++++++++

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs,
and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our
money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you
do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this
golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!
