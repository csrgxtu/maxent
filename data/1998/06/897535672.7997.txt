Health Alert:

Wake Up, We're Killing Ourselves!

Dear Reader,

 
Here are some facts about Harsh, Toxic, Industrial Chemicals 
that are invading our lives:

 FACT   Many of our personal care items have warning 
       labels that we don't know about, or we ignore them!

 FACT   When some of these ingredients interact with other
       substances they can increase the risk of cancer.

 FACT   In 1938, when the FDA grandfathered these ingredients
       as safe, no studies were done on long term use of products
       with so-called acceptable amounts of these ingredients.

 FACT   It is NOW known these ingredients do get into our bodies
       through their intended use.

20 years from now, what will we have proven about these ingredients,
their use and their effect on our health? Are there any clues today
that might help?

WE THINK SO!  We're sick of being lied to by big business cosmetic 
Industries, and we hope you are too!

Before you dismiss this, go to your bathroom and read some labels.
You'll find Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Propylene Glycol (not to
mention dozens of other chemicals) in toothpaste's, conditioners,
cosmetics, shampoos, lotions, and many other common products...

Please request more information from us about these chemicals.
This Information is free. Please ask us to email it to you.
Please type "Send Info" in the subject line to <jkl13@hotmail.com>

relevant subjects such as:
